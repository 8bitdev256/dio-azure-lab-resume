# Azure Cloud - Cloud Types

## Private Cloud

 - 100% On-Premise Environment. You have your architecture, servers, routers, firewall and others, but it is only for your company.

 - Organizations create a cloud environment in their datacenter.

 - Organizations are responsible to operate the services they provide.

 - Does not provide access to users outside the organization.

## Public Cloud

 - Delivery of services and resources to a range of customers through a single provider. Example: Azure.

## Hybrid Cloud

 - Assuming that your company already uses a private cloud, but you realize that it is too much work to create a data center, buy a server, and other resources needed to provide the cloud service, you decide to use a hybrid cloud. In this type of cloud, your company has both a private and a public cloud, and the two can communicate resources with each other.

 ## Multi Cloud

  - It is a type of cloud where your company has both private and public cloud types, but the public cloud types that the company uses are in more than one provider. Example: Azure and AWS.
  
# Azure - Cloud Model Comparison

## Public Cloud

 - No capital expenditure to scale vertically: You pay for what you use in specified period of time. Example: You pay for a server you used for 15 days

 - Applications can be provisioned and de-provisioned quickly. If you have chosen an incorrect configuration for storage, network, server, etc., this can be quickly undone

 - Organizations pay only for what they use

 - The responsibility for the hardware lies with the cloud service used (Azure, AWS, etc.)

 - Regarding security, the cloud service provides tools, but it is your responsibility to configure them to your needs

## Private Cloud

 - Organizations have full control and responsibility over resources and security

 - Organizations are responsible for hardware/software maintenance and upgrades

## Hybrid Cloud

 - Organizations determine where (on which country's server) to run their applications

 - Organizations control security, compliance, and legal requirements

 - Provides greater flexibility

## Azure - CapEx and OpEx

### CapEx (Capital expenditures)

 - The initial outlay of money on physical infrastructure: buy servers, network equipment, storage, among others;

 - CapEx expenses have a value that decreases over time: You invest in infrastructure, but your spending decreases after the investment, because after the investment, you will only pay for the resources to keep the infrastructure running.

### OpEx (Operating expenses)

 - Spend on products and services as needed, pay as you go

 - Get charged immediately
